Conditions for the use of FORM
==============================

The use of the FORM program and programs in the distribution is free of charge
but subject to the following conditions:

   1. The programs are `as is'. That is, neither the author(s) nor his/their
	  employer(s) is/are to be held responsible in any way for any errors or
	  malfunctioning of the programs.
   2. The programs are not to be redistributed in any version that is modified
	  from the original distribution version unless with the specific consent of
	  the author. In particular this license file is to be part of any
	  redistribution.
   3. The programs are not to be redistributed in exchange for money or made
	  part of any commercial deal without the explicit written consent of the
	  author.
   4. When the FORM program is used for scientific work that leads to
	  publication in a scientific journal, this work should refer to the use of
	  FORM by the following citation: J.A.M.Vermaseren "New features of FORM"
	  math-ph/0010025 or something similar that is acceptable for the journal of
	  publication.

Some remarks:

ad 1: It is always wise to make cross checks on your calculations. It is
	  virtually impossible to make more than 2 Mbytes of code without errors. If
	  you do believe that you ran into an error, please try to make a bug report
	  and try to keep it as concise as possible. Send bug reports to
	  "form@nikhef.nl".

ad 2: It is to nobodies advantage if different versions of programs start
	  floating around. If someone has a sensible modification of any of the
	  programs, please send it to "form@nikhef.nl".
	  If possible the author(s) will then include this modification in the
	  distribution (with mentioning the source of it).

ad 3: If somebody is going to earn money by distributing FORM or making it part
	  of a commercial product, maybe it is not a bad idea to not forget the
	  author(s). This could even help in the service department.

ad 4: NIKHEF, my home institute and FOM, its granting agency have allowed me to
	  spend enormous amounts of time on the making and improving of FORM. At the
	  same time, one of the ways they measure `productivity' is by citations. It
	  would be nice to show them something for all this work.

More remarks: If you do not agree with the above conditions, you have two
options:

    * You do not use FORM and the other programs included in the distribution.
	* You let the author(s) know about reasonable improvements of the above
	  conditions. If they are mutually acceptable, you might still be allowed to
	  use the programs.
